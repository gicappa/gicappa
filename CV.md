# Gian Carlo Pace

## Personal Profile
Software is my passion. I have been a passionate coder from the age of eleven when I received my first computer for christmas (C=64). I graduated in software engineering at Politecnico di Milano, and I’m professionally involved in the IT field from more than 20 years.

I love writing clean, readable and maintainable code, I am passionate about designing scalable and highly available architectures, and I am into agile methods and practice since 2003.

During my career, I fell in love with open source technologies, and I understood the value of sharing knowledge and giving back to the community.
The opensource involvement taught me that communication and continuous learning are indispensable grounds to build a successful software product.
When I founded a software shop, I had to work overnight, during the weekend, and I started searching for a better way to create software products on time and budget, and I stumbled upon agile methods.
I’ve been working for large TLC and for small and promising startups and, astoundingly, I still love designing architectures, developing software and building products together with great people.

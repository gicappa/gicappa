# Gian Carlo's github profile

In my life software has always rimed with passion. I have been a passionate coder from the tender age of eleven, I graduated in software engineering at Politecnico di Milano and Iâ€™m professionally involved in the IT field from more than 20 years.
I started my career path learning how to develop software and manage IT project in an enterprise environment but after a short time I stumbeld upon the open source world and people. I opened a software company named **Webrise** and I started working as consultant for the TLC Fastweb (Italy) and Vodafone (Germany) and for startups like Gild (USA), Jobrapido (Italy) and Etalia (Switzerland). 
I'm passionate about technologies and architectures with a particular attention to scalability and high availability systems.  
Currenlty I'm working with the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC) in 2015 and I'm contributing as software architect and developer to the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) for Maritime Surveillance project.

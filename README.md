# Hi! :wave: I am Gian Carlo.

I am a passionate **software engineer** and **software architect** with more than twenty years of experience. 

*My interests are software architectures, distributed systems, interoperbility, system scalability and high availability, software development and its lifecyle.*

- I have started coding when I was eleven, I graduated in software engineering at Politecnico di Milano and Iâ€™m professionally involved in the IT field from more than 20 years.
- I opened a software company named **Webrise** and I started working as consultant for the TLC Fastweb (Italy) and Vodafone (Germany) and for startups like Gild (USA), Jobrapido (Italy) and Etalia (Switzerland).
- Since 2015 I'm working for the European Commission in the project *Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) for Maritime Surveillance*.

# Hi! :wave: I am Gian Carlo.

**Software Architect** and **Engineer** with 25+ years of experience crafting scalable, distributed systems. Passionate about designing architectures that drive interoperability, resilience, and innovation.

_My interests are software architectures, distributed systems, interoperability, system scalability and high availability, software development and its lifecycle_.

- I started coding when I was eleven, eventually graduating in software engineering at **Politecnico di Milano**.
- Professionally immersed in the IT field for over 25 years, I founded the software company **Webrise**. My consulting journey led me to collaborate with companies like TLC Fastweb (Italy), Vodafone (Germany), and startups such as Gild (USA), Jobrapido (Italy), and Etalia (Switzerland).
- During the 6-year time spent at the **European Commission**, I contributed to the **Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE)** project for Maritime Surveillance. This initiative connected maritime public authorities across Europe, enhancing safety and security for European citizens.
- Prensently, I'm working with **Hyland** focusing on Enterprise Content Management systems, and _continuing enjoying my job_.
